# Go-DNS-Benchmark
A pretty simple tool I made in Golang to benchmark and measure DNS server performance


# Features
* Multithreading 
* Results (Avg. Resolve time, Domains resolved, Domains that failed to be resolved)
* Individual domain resolve time

(That's all for now but I'm open to suggestions)
 
 
# Compiling
`go build resolve.go`
